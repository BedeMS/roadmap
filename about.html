      <p class="about__desc">
        The purpose of this website is to give you a self-taught developer path
        (curriculum). Sort of like you're own personal bootcamp but on your own
        pace. The end goal is to make you a Self-taught developer. One of the
        most challenging parts when starting out is where to begin. A sea of
        information on where, what, how, why and everything else in between. As
        a beginner, alone, you'll drown. That's why I have created this Roadmap.
        It gives you a curriculum you can follow based on your timeline. All the
        courses provided for you to follow either come from youtube (free) or
        udemy ($15; they go on sale every 2 weeks). I'm not an instructor, but
        the courses I recommend are courses I've completed myself. The
        instructors are all great instructors and are well known in the
        developer community. So get started with you're own personal roadmap.
